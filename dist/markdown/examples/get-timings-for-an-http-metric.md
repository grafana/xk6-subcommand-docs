# Get timings for an HTTP metric

To access the timing information from an individual HTTP request, the Response.timings object provides the time spent on the various phases in `ms`.
One use case of this is to use the timings in a Custom metric to make a trend for a specific endpoint.

The timings are as follows:

- blocked: equals to `http_req_blocked`.
- connecting: equals to `http_req_connecting`.
- tls_handshaking: equals to `http_req_tls_handshaking`.
- sending: equals to `http_req_sending`.
- waiting: equals to `http_req_waiting`.
- receiving: equals to `http_req_receiving`.
- duration: equals to `http_req_duration`.

This script gets the request duration timing for a specific GET request and logs it to the console.

```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';

export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://quickpizza.grafana.com/');
  console.log('Response time was ' + String(res.timings.duration) + ' ms');
}
```

The expected (partial) output looks like this:

```bash
$ k6 run script.js

  INFO[0001] Response time was 337.962473 ms               source=console
```
