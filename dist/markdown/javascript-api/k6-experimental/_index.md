> **Caution:** This is an experimental module.
> 
> 
> While we intend to keep experimental modules as stable as possible, we may need to introduce breaking changes. This could happen at future k6 releases until the module becomes fully stable and graduates as a k6 core module. For more information, refer to the [versioning and stability guarantees document](/docs/k6/v1.5.0/reference/versioning-and-stability-guarantees/#experimental).
> 
> 
> Experimental modules maintain a high level of stability and follow regular maintenance and security measures. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues) if you have any feedback or suggestions.
